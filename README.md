cycles-xml-exporter
===================

Blender to standalone Cycles exporter.

This is meant to replace the exporter which comes with blender, which is only
capable of exporting meshes. This one attempts to export as much as blender's
scene as possible.

Kiki: I've modified this exporter a bit to fix it for modern blender and support lights and light shaders.  Please still consider this a proof of concept.
